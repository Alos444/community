We also have a minor improvement budget where the Neighbourhood Committee in the East will review and approve each proposal for improvement funding on our estates. The Neighbourhood Committee is made up of a group of residents from across Tower Hamlets, Newham and Barking and Dagenham. The chair for the current NC lives in Tower Hamlets and is also on our Resident Board. , The Redbrick TRA has been instrumental in the regeneration programme at New Union Wharf and the chair and sub-chair have been involved in regular meetings with us to ensure we comply with the offer document put in place by East Thames. , L&Q also sits on the board for ORT (Ocean Regeneration Trust) which works with the local community on the Ocean Estate and supports a number of community initiatives. The ORT board works closely with the TRA's and active resident groups across the Ocean Estate, Grand Union Place and the Feeder sites. , We also carry out joint reviews of service charges with the TRA and active resident groups before the finals are issued out to all residents. The collaborative approach with residents has been beneficial for both parties to ensure the costs we pass on have been audited by residents before sent out to the wider estate.",
